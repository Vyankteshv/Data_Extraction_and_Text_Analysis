need a chatbot by ajay bidyarthy september 22 2020 19663 mr sakamoto is a bonsai artist lives downtown kyoto japan bonsai is a japanese art form that is the cultivation of small trees in a small or medium container he is in this field of business for the last ten years and he loves what he does on a daily basis people from different cities in japan come to buy his artwork but in the early stage of his business he was just another regular bosai artist his popularity has increased because of the stories he tells for every art he is selling his customer immediately loved him for this while buying a bonsai art he loved to sell his customer with his artwork and a story related to that product which resurrects his presence through his art in customers soon enough his business thrived and nowadays he is always busy after the digital revolution although his sales increased he was not happy he was not satisfied something is eating up his mind day by day he could not understand what\\u2019s the reason behind his remorse a chatbot is an awesome invention of the digital revolution it is the reallife embodiment of customer engagement every business needs this feature will be an understatement because customer engagement is the base of any business the chatbot does the exact thing digitally it helps customers to answer the queries and tell about the product that the business has to offer is a fully automated way with vibrant customizations mr sakamoto is running his business for the last fifteen years now and now he is happy that he was not for the past couple of years the rationale behind his happiness is the chatbot though he has a website and app to sell his bonsai art he could not engage with the customers in the way he wanted to he has trained his employees and apprentices but they are not providing the same service in the way he does he was unsatisfied and the chatbot relives him from his sadness he has done all that at affordable prices in no time let\\u2019s understand the mr sakamoto\\u2019s \\u201cmondai nai\\u201d perspective about why chatbot is the answer of his problems building the trust with customers this is the fundamental and root cause for which mr sakamoto has to implement the chatbot in the first place his stories are embedded with each art the product which he sells needs this story to be with it his stories which were not been told to all the customers before are now sharing with this chatbot and building the trust between them we all can agree on this one statement that trust is the most impactful aspect maybe the best of aspects in the relation between any customer and businessowner whether the business is small medium or large target the millennial customer millennials a word that was not introduced before 1990 the generation which is stuck in between genx and geny a generation of people accustomed to both digitization and old culture they are the most targeted audience in this era what else would be more approachable to this generation than a chatbot it\\u2019s easy less time consuming to use mr sakamoto is now one of the few genx persons who can do business with the millennial so easily better human interactions mr sakamoto has some employees and apprentices he has trained them as per his needs but there is a limit they can\\u2019t deliver the exact things that he can or the way he does neither chatbot can do that exactly it will accurately follow the instructions not only the chatbot solve the queries of the customer in his way but also give a recommendation to the product in the way he wants too is there any more attribute he would care about that absolutely no 247 service the most expensive thing for any businessman is the return of their customer with an empty hand because of his unavailability a chatbot is a perfect way to solve it for mr sakamoto\\u2019s customized chatbot is not only present for customers in their availability but also it was giving the response to the customer in all the time zone all over the world mr sakamoto wouldn\\u2019t be happier for this feature scaling up business in globalization in the era of globalization what is more helpful than a chatbot it can be customized in any language it can be accessed by any human being residing in any part of the world and at the end of the day when that foreigner is happy with the buy and the felicitation and says \\u201carigato\\u201d but in his own language at that moment he feels so warm and happy handling a lot of customers is really hard he assigned employees but the rate is growing fast so in the competition of the market mr sakamoto took the help of a chatbot now this automated customized application is handling a greater number of customers than his employees can do his business is growing exponentially now when you found out why mr sakamoto is happy and his business is growing in this competitive industry then do you still have a question in mind that why does your business need a chatbot blackcoffer insights 20 aniket bhunia netaji subhash engineering college previous articlehow you lead a project or a team without any technical expertisenext articlepayroll

and its impact on livelihood by 2040 by ajay bidyarthy january 2 2023 10692 \\u201cmore gains on quality affordability and accessibility are on the way\\u201d what do telemed means as the world evolves and advances so does technology which in turn impacts our daily lives one of that advancement is telemedicine it\\u2019s not an overnight change but more like how summer turns into fall \\u2013 gradual yet very perceptible we are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare how will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040 i believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes but first of all what is telemedicine it is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another role of telemed during a pandemic telemedicine\\u2019s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic the ubiquitous smartphone capable of video interactions can be a lifeline for underserved populations in rural areas with few mental health professionals for example intermountain\\u2019s\\u2019s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care early in the covid19 pandemic telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare when the pandemic forced the closure of inperson clinics and offices psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled inperson visits advantages of telemed in today\\u2019s era patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a twopronged nightmare there\\u2019s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist patients may bounce from one local physician to the next wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights telemedicine offers a far better solution virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice by eliminating the barriers of time and distance telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases the first is misdiagnosis the second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan rise of the telemedicine industry postpandemic source the indian express this stepchange borne out of necessity was enabled by these factors 1 increased consumer willingness to use telehealth 2 increased provider willingness to use telehealth and 3 regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement during the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtualinperson care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but\\u2014as expected\\u2014this view varies widely depending on the type of care overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties exhibit 2 around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward\\u2014up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before covid19 its impact on human beings over the years moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a \\u201cdigital front door\\u201d or lowercost virtualfirst health plan6 however a gap has historically existed between consumers\\u2019 expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and inperson with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual

need a chatbot by ajay bidyarthy september 22 2020 19663 mr sakamoto is a bonsai artist lives downtown kyoto japan bonsai is a japanese art form that is the cultivation of small trees in a small or medium container he is in this field of business for the last ten years and he loves what he does on a daily basis people from different cities in japan come to buy his artwork but in the early stage of his business he was just another regular bosai artist his popularity has increased because of the stories he tells for every art he is selling his customer immediately loved him for this while buying a bonsai art he loved to sell his customer with his artwork and a story related to that product which resurrects his presence through his art in customers soon enough his business thrived and nowadays he is always busy after the digital revolution although his sales increased he was not happy he was not satisfied something is eating up his mind day by day he could not understand what\\u2019s the reason behind his remorse a chatbot is an awesome invention of the digital revolution it is the reallife embodiment of customer engagement every business needs this feature will be an understatement because customer engagement is the base of any business the chatbot does the exact thing digitally it helps customers to answer the queries and tell about the product that the business has to offer is a fully automated way with vibrant customizations mr sakamoto is running his business for the last fifteen years now and now he is happy that he was not for the past couple of years the rationale behind his happiness is the chatbot though he has a website and app to sell his bonsai art he could not engage with the customers in the way he wanted to he has trained his employees and apprentices but they are not providing the same service in the way he does he was unsatisfied and the chatbot relives him from his sadness he has done all that at affordable prices in no time let\\u2019s understand the mr sakamoto\\u2019s \\u201cmondai nai\\u201d perspective about why chatbot is the answer of his problems building the trust with customers this is the fundamental and root cause for which mr sakamoto has to implement the chatbot in the first place his stories are embedded with each art the product which he sells needs this story to be with it his stories which were not been told to all the customers before are now sharing with this chatbot and building the trust between them we all can agree on this one statement that trust is the most impactful aspect maybe the best of aspects in the relation between any customer and businessowner whether the business is small medium or large target the millennial customer millennials a word that was not introduced before 1990 the generation which is stuck in between genx and geny a generation of people accustomed to both digitization and old culture they are the most targeted audience in this era what else would be more approachable to this generation than a chatbot it\\u2019s easy less time consuming to use mr sakamoto is now one of the few genx persons who can do business with the millennial so easily better human interactions mr sakamoto has some employees and apprentices he has trained them as per his needs but there is a limit they can\\u2019t deliver the exact things that he can or the way he does neither chatbot can do that exactly it will accurately follow the instructions not only the chatbot solve the queries of the customer in his way but also give a recommendation to the product in the way he wants too is there any more attribute he would care about that absolutely no 247 service the most expensive thing for any businessman is the return of their customer with an empty hand because of his unavailability a chatbot is a perfect way to solve it for mr sakamoto\\u2019s customized chatbot is not only present for customers in their availability but also it was giving the response to the customer in all the time zone all over the world mr sakamoto wouldn\\u2019t be happier for this feature scaling up business in globalization in the era of globalization what is more helpful than a chatbot it can be customized in any language it can be accessed by any human being residing in any part of the world and at the end of the day when that foreigner is happy with the buy and the felicitation and says \\u201carigato\\u201d but in his own language at that moment he feels so warm and happy handling a lot of customers is really hard he assigned employees but the rate is growing fast so in the competition of the market mr sakamoto took the help of a chatbot now this automated customized application is handling a greater number of customers than his employees can do his business is growing exponentially now when you found out why mr sakamoto is happy and his business is growing in this competitive industry then do you still have a question in mind that why does your business need a chatbot blackcoffer insights 20 aniket bhunia netaji subhash engineering college previous articlehow you lead a project or a team without any technical expertisenext articlepayroll

evolves and advances so does technology which in turn impacts our daily lives one of that advancement is telemedicine it\\u2019s not an overnight change but more like how summer turns into fall \\u2013 gradual yet very perceptible we are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare how will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040 i believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes but first of all what is telemedicine it is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another role of telemed during a pandemic telemedicine\\u2019s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic the ubiquitous smartphone capable of video interactions can be a lifeline for underserved populations in rural areas with few mental health professionals for example intermountain\\u2019s\\u2019s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care early in the covid19 pandemic telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare when the pandemic forced the closure of inperson clinics and offices psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled inperson visits advantages of telemed in today\\u2019s era patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a twopronged nightmare there\\u2019s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist patients may bounce from one local physician to the next wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights telemedicine offers a far better solution virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice by eliminating the barriers of time and distance telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases the first is misdiagnosis the second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan rise of the telemedicine industry postpandemic source the indian express this stepchange borne out of necessity was enabled by these factors 1 increased consumer willingness to use telehealth 2 increased provider willingness to use telehealth and 3 regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement during the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtualinperson care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but\\u2014as expected\\u2014this view varies widely depending on the type of care overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties exhibit 2 around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward\\u2014up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before covid19 its impact on human beings over the years moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a \\u201cdigital front door\\u201d or lowercost virtualfirst health plan6 however a gap has historically existed between consumers\\u2019 expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and inperson with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care it could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year as of july 2021 we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial covid19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward the findings include the following insights \\u201c telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38x higher than before the pandemic similarly consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the precovid19 era investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed fuelling further innovation virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating\\u201d access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities despite the challenges ahead substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic is the rise in telemed industry temporary or will keep growing the trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care in some areas such as urgent care and specialty care patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions moving forward there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike role of business leaders in achieving new model when creating a new model of health care the hard work is in the details and because a teledriven system will affect every aspect of care delivery developing one entails thousands of decisions medical and financial leaders will need to design shape and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for the specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article but here are two major considerations reimbursement and care delivery requisites businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required they should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines even before covid19 struck sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 55 annually businesses can expect extremely high medicalcost inflation if nothing is done the time to act is now summing it up lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce the pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes done well the transition to a teledriven health system could be accomplished in a few years if left to chance it could take decades\\u2014if it happens at all the current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system but we must act quickly blackcoffer insights

need a chatbot by ajay bidyarthy september 22 2020 19663 mr sakamoto is a bonsai artist lives downtown kyoto japan bonsai is a japanese art form that is the cultivation of small trees in a small or medium container he is in this field of business for the last ten years and he loves what he does on a daily basis people from different cities in japan come to buy his artwork but in the early stage of his business he was just another regular bosai artist his popularity has increased because of the stories he tells for every art he is selling his customer immediately loved him for this while buying a bonsai art he loved to sell his customer with his artwork and a story related to that product which resurrects his presence through his art in customers soon enough his business thrived and nowadays he is always busy after the digital revolution although his sales increased he was not happy he was not satisfied something is eating up his mind day by day he could not understand what\\u2019s the reason behind his remorse a chatbot is an awesome invention of the digital revolution it is the reallife embodiment of customer engagement every business needs this feature will be an understatement because customer engagement is the base of any business the chatbot does the exact thing digitally it helps customers to answer the queries and tell about the product that the business has to offer is a fully automated way with vibrant customizations mr sakamoto is running his business for the last fifteen years now and now he is happy that he was not for the past couple of years the rationale behind his happiness is the chatbot though he has a website and app to sell his bonsai art he could not engage with the customers in the way he wanted to he has trained his employees and apprentices but they are not providing the same service in the way he does he was unsatisfied and the chatbot relives him from his sadness he has done all that at affordable prices in no time let\\u2019s understand the mr sakamoto\\u2019s \\u201cmondai nai\\u201d perspective about why chatbot is the answer of his problems building the trust with customers this is the fundamental and root cause for which mr sakamoto has to implement the chatbot in the first place his stories are embedded with each art the product which he sells needs this story to be with it his stories which were not been told to all the customers before are now sharing with this chatbot and building the trust between them we all can agree on this one statement that trust is the most impactful aspect maybe the best of aspects in the relation between any customer and businessowner whether the business is small medium or large target the millennial customer millennials a word that was not introduced before 1990 the generation which is stuck in between genx and geny a generation of people accustomed to both digitization and old culture they are the most targeted audience in this era what else would be more approachable to this generation than a chatbot it\\u2019s easy less time consuming to use mr sakamoto is now one of the few genx persons who can do business with the millennial so easily better human interactions mr sakamoto has some employees and apprentices he has trained them as per his needs but there is a limit they can\\u2019t deliver the exact things that he can or the way he does neither chatbot can do that exactly it will accurately follow the instructions not only the chatbot solve the queries of the customer in his way but also give a recommendation to the product in the way he wants too is there any more attribute he would care about that absolutely no 247 service the most expensive thing for any businessman is the return of their customer with an empty hand because of his unavailability a chatbot is a perfect way to solve it for mr sakamoto\\u2019s customized chatbot is not only present for customers in their availability but also it was giving the response to the customer in all the time zone all over the world mr sakamoto wouldn\\u2019t be happier for this feature scaling up business in globalization in the era of globalization what is more helpful than a chatbot it can be customized in any language it can be accessed by any human being residing in any part of the world and at the end of the day when that foreigner is happy with the buy and the felicitation and says \\u201carigato\\u201d but in his own language at that moment he feels so warm and happy handling a lot of customers is really hard he assigned employees but the rate is growing fast so in the competition of the market mr sakamoto took the help of a chatbot now this automated customized application is handling a greater number of customers than his employees can do his business is growing exponentially now when you found out why mr sakamoto is happy and his business is growing in this competitive industry then do you still have a question in mind that why does your business need a chatbot blackcoffer insights 20 aniket bhunia netaji subhash engineering college previous articlehow you lead a project or a team without any technical expertisenext articlepayroll

and its impact on livelihood by 2040 by ajay bidyarthy january 2 2023 10692 \\u201cmore gains on quality affordability and accessibility are on the way\\u201d what do telemed means as the world evolves and advances so does technology which in turn impacts our daily lives one of that advancement is telemedicine it\\u2019s not an overnight change but more like how summer turns into fall \\u2013 gradual yet very perceptible we are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare how will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040 i believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes but first of all what is telemedicine it is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another role of telemed during a pandemic telemedicine\\u2019s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic the ubiquitous smartphone capable of video interactions can be a lifeline for underserved populations in rural areas with few mental health professionals for example intermountain\\u2019s\\u2019s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care early in the covid19 pandemic telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare when the pandemic forced the closure of inperson clinics and offices psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled inperson visits advantages of telemed in today\\u2019s era patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a twopronged nightmare there\\u2019s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist patients may bounce from one local physician to the next wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights telemedicine offers a far better solution virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice by eliminating the barriers of time and distance telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases the first is misdiagnosis the second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan rise of the telemedicine industry postpandemic source the indian express this stepchange borne out of necessity was enabled by these factors 1 increased consumer willingness to use telehealth 2 increased provider willingness to use telehealth and 3 regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement during the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtualinperson care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but\\u2014as expected\\u2014this view varies widely depending on the type of care overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties exhibit 2 around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward\\u2014up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before covid19 its impact on human beings over the years moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a \\u201cdigital front door\\u201d or lowercost virtualfirst health plan6 however a gap has historically existed between consumers\\u2019 expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and inperson with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care it could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year as of july 2021 we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial covid19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward the findings include the following insights \\u201c telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38x higher than before the pandemic similarly consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the precovid19 era investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed fuelling further innovation virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating\\u201d access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities despite the challenges ahead substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic is the rise in telemed industry temporary or will keep growing the trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care in some areas such as urgent care and specialty care patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions moving forward there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike role of business leaders in achieving new model when creating a new model of health care the hard work is in the details and because a teledriven system will affect every aspect of care delivery developing one entails thousands of decisions medical and financial leaders will need to design shape and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for the specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article but here are two major considerations reimbursement and care delivery requisites businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required they should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines even before covid19 struck sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 55 annually businesses can expect extremely high medicalcost inflation if nothing is done the time to act is now summing it up lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce the pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes done well the transition to a teledriven health system could be accomplished in a few years if left to chance it could take decades\\u2014if it happens at all the current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system but we must act quickly blackcoffer insights
